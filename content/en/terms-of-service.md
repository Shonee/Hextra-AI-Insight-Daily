# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** welcomes you! Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using **ai.hubtoday**, you're essentially saying "I agree" to everything here. 😉

## 1. Our Services Unpacked
So, **what do our services offer**? We're all about giving our users a sweet deal with paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, special resources, e-books, and even community vibes! Just a heads-up: some of the extra cool stuff is only for our subscribed members. ✨

## 2. User Accounts & Registration 🔐
- **To register an account**, users simply need a valid email address and a solid password. Easy peasy!
- **Your account** is your responsibility! You're in charge of its security and everything that happens under it. **Absolutely NO** transferring or sharing your account, got it?
- **If you break the rules**, know that we've got the right to **pause or even terminate** your account. Let's keep things fair! 🙏

## 3. Paid Subscription Services 💸
- **Our subscription services** are super straightforward: you can opt for monthly or annual billing, and all the fees are clearly laid out for you on the checkout page. No hidden surprises here!
- **For payments**, we keep things secure! All transactions go through awesome third-party payment platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We **never** store your payment info on our end. 🔒
- **Your subscription** is set up for automatic renewal, which means seamless access! Just remember to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want it to renew. Easy peasy.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet for first-timers! If you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of your initial purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (find it at the end of these terms!) and tell us why you're leaving. Heads up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, payments are typically **non-refundable**, unless the law says otherwise. No hard feelings! 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property 💡
- **Our original content**? It's all **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**! That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our explicit permission. Let's respect the creators! ✍️
- **As a user**, you get awesome access – but it's a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure. Think of it as your personal library card!
- **Need to use our content commercially** or for a big-time citation? No sweat! Just get in touch with us to snag the proper authorization. We're usually happy to help out. 😊

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines 🚫
- **Here's what we absolutely CANNOT tolerate**: Don't upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it clean and respectful, folks!
- **And a big NO-NO**: Please don't try to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member-exclusive content using any technical trickery. That's just not cool. 🙅‍♀️
- **If rules are broken**, we reserve the right to yank down any inappropriate content and **ban users** who can't play nice. Fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions 🛠️
- **We might tweak things sometimes**: We totally reserve the right to change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, and we might not always be able to give you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls!
- **When things go sideways (rarely, we hope!)**: If, by some chance, you can't access content temporarily because of stuff like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages, please know that we **won't be on the hook for any compensation**. We'll always do our best to get things back up and running pronto, though! 🤞

## 7. Disclaimer – Read This! 🚨
- **Heads up on our info**: What we share here is purely for your reference and general knowledge. It's **definitely NOT** professional advice of any kind (think financial, legal, medical – you name it!). Always consult a pro for that! 🧑‍💼
- **About any losses**: If something goes wrong and you experience any direct or indirect losses from using our content or services, we're super sorry, but **we can't be held responsible**. Just wanted to make that crystal clear!

## 8. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution ⚖️
- **When it comes to the law**: These Terms of Service are all about the awesome laws of the State of California, USA! We'll interpret them according to California law, without worrying about those tricky conflict-of-law principles. So Cal for the win! 🌴
- **Got a dispute?**: If anything ever pops up related to these terms, let's first try to sort it out friendly-style through negotiation. If we just can't see eye-to-eye, you agree that any beef will be settled by the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Fingers crossed we never get there! 🤞
