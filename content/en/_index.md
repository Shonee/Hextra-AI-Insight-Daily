### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Kuaishou's Keling AI has launched a new Subject Library feature on its O1 model, pushing character consistency past 96%!** 🚀 Users can upload a single image to generate multi-angle and lighting variations, supporting cross-scene calls. The system automatically extracts style keywords, and the Pro version costs 29 RMB/month. This allows filmmakers to batch-generate storyboards and merchants to reduce try-on video costs by 90% (super cool!). Multi-person collaboration will be rolled out next quarter. <br/>![AI News: Kuaishou's Keling Subject Library Multimodal Generation Interface](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbza215je0jr2m17ps5t7a1b.avif)<br/>

2.  **Perplexity has unveiled BrowseSafe, its new system boasting a 91% defense rate against prompt injection attacks – that's 6 percentage points higher than GPT-5!** This new system employs a three-layer defense strategy. Cristiano Ronaldo has announced his investment in Perplexity and signed a global endorsement deal, with the platform set to launch a [Fan Interaction Hub (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23469). While BrowseSafe's benchmarks and models are now open source, its detection rate for multilingual attacks currently stands at 76% 🔒.

3.  **Stanford's CS146S course has completely banned coding, making it an all-AI practical experience!** Students are required to develop software using [Cursor and Claude (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-12-08-7), submitting chat logs alongside their projects. The waiting list for this course is already over 200 people long 🔥. The ten-week curriculum covers coding agents, terminal automation, and security vulnerability detection. Lead instructor Eric, who previously worked in Stanford's NLP group, will launch a public version of the course for professional developers next year (woohoo!).

4.  **ChatGPT is offering a free month of use when you cancel your subscription!** If you click "cancel subscription" in your account settings on the web version, the system will pop up a free month offer. Several [overseas users (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pgoc3j/) have confirmed this applies to the Plus plan 💡, and the action must be completed in a browser. This strategy is likely aimed at retaining users and is currently limited to individual account verification. <br/>

5.  **Luo Yonghao, at the GeekPark conference, slammed the "AI phone hype," pointing out that Apple, Huawei, and OV haven't launched genuine [AI phone products (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23463) in three years.** His own "Doubao" phone has faced account restrictions from mainstream apps due to "abnormal operations" 🚫, emphasizing that ecological competition is far more complex than technology alone. Luo himself remains focused on AR entrepreneurship, believing that AI assistants will eventually become ubiquitous. <br/>

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **MIT's 15-year research, published in Nature Neuroscience, has pinpointed a human brain "language chip" no larger than a strawberry!** This network, located in the left inferior frontal gyrus, measures just 4.2 cm³ 🧠. Data from 212 aphasia patients proves that language and thought modules are completely decoupled, and the [probability map has been open-sourced (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23443). Meta and DeepMind have already cited this map to optimize large model architectures and brain-computer interface designs. A dual-region stimulation protocol is expected to be released in Q2 next year.

2.  **Alibaba has launched Live Avatar, a system capable of real-time generation of virtual humans for unlimited durations!** This system supports 20 frames/second voice-driven animation and can run continuously for over 3 hours 💫. It maintains stable character appearance through a three-layer anti-drift mechanism, combined with the [Qwen3 model (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/a066c4/) to achieve two-way interaction between language and expressions. The technology employs streaming block generation, with the student model achieving teacher model quality through self-reinforcement training (pretty neat!). Both the paper and code are now publicly available. <br/>![AI News: Live Avatar Real-time Generation Process Demo](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbza29rce1ht8sdn2p1vce2g.avif)<br/>

3.  **ICLR 2026 submissions are facing an academic crisis, with 50 cases of hallucinated citations already discovered!** A research team found unretrievable fabricated references in 300 samples, estimating that 20,000 submissions could contain hundreds of such instances. The discussion is sharply focused on the balance between [author responsibility (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46181466) and tool accountability 🔥. The community suggests using BibTeX validation and RAG retrieval, but the detection tool GPTZero has been questioned for potential false positives. Academia is calling for the establishment of cross-institutional disclosure and disciplinary mechanisms. <br/>

4.  **Google has released its Titans inference-time memory architecture, but without open-sourcing the weights – a move drawing community criticism.** The paper proposes using gradients as a "surprise signal" to instantly update memory modules, supporting ultra-long context [self-modifying learning (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46181231). The HOPE solution, combined with a CMS system, achieves hierarchical persistent memory 💡. The community is criticizing Google for only releasing papers and not models, a stark contrast to the strategies of Meta and DeepSeek. Security discussions are focusing on data poisoning risks and alignment issues. <br/>

5.  **Stanford has proposed LaserMix++, a semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation framework that's a real game-changer!** This framework integrates multi-sensor supplementation, enabling feature distillation from cameras to LiDAR 🚗. It achieves full supervised accuracy with only one-fifth of the labeled data and has been validated on multiple [driving datasets (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05258). It supports general applications for cross-LiDAR representation, significantly reducing outdoor re-shooting costs. The technology incorporates multimodal LaserMix operations and language knowledge guidance. <br/>
